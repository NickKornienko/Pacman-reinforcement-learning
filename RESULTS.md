## Analysis

### Basic DQN

- **Best Overall Performance**: Achieved highest average score (46.00) and completion rate (90.00%)
- **Efficient Exploration**: Lowest average steps per episode (159.40), indicating more direct path-finding
- **Stability**: Consistent performance across episodes with good score distribution
- **Advantages**: Simpler architecture proved more effective for the Pacman environment

### Sophisticated DQN

- **Mixed Results**: Lower average score (19.00) despite enhanced action space
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Higher average steps (465.20) suggests more exploration but less efficient goal achievement
- **Complex Actions**: The enhanced action space (15 actions vs 4) may have made it harder to learn optimal policies
- **Limitations**: Additional complexity didn't translate to better performance

### Dueling DQN

- **Moderate Performance**: Slightly better than Sophisticated DQN (avg score 20.00)
- **Better Completion**: Higher completion rate (70.00%) than Sophisticated DQN
- **Efficiency Issues**: High average steps (410.60) indicates less efficient path-finding
- **Value Estimation**: Separate value and advantage streams didn't provide significant benefits

## Key Findings

1. **Simplicity vs Complexity**

   - Basic DQN's simpler architecture outperformed more complex variants
   - Additional action space and architectural complexity may have hindered learning

2. **Exploration Efficiency**

   - Basic DQN showed more efficient exploration patterns
   - Complex variants spent more time exploring but achieved lower scores

3. **Learning Stability**

   - Basic DQN demonstrated more stable learning
   - Complex variants showed higher variance in performance

4. **Action Space Impact**
   - Larger action space in Sophisticated DQN didn't improve performance
   - May indicate that simpler action spaces are more suitable for this environment

## Conclusions

1. The basic DQN implementation proves most effective for the Pacman environment, suggesting that simpler architectures can be more suitable for discrete, grid-based environments.

2. The addition of sophisticated features (enhanced action space, dueling networks) didn't translate to better performance, indicating potential overfitting or increased difficulty in learning optimal policies.

3. The results suggest that for similar grid-based environments:
   - Simpler architectures might be preferable
   - Basic action spaces can be more effective
   - Complex architectural features should be carefully evaluated for their practical benefits

## Future Recommendations

1. **Hyperparameter Optimization**

   - Fine-tune learning rates and exploration parameters
   - Experiment with different network architectures

2. **Training Duration**

   - Extend training episodes to see if complex variants improve with more training
   - Investigate learning curve stability over longer periods

3. **Feature Engineering**

   - Evaluate different state representations
   - Consider simplified versions of the enhanced action space

4. **Architecture Modifications**
   - Test hybrid approaches combining successful elements
   - Explore simpler variants of the dueling architecture

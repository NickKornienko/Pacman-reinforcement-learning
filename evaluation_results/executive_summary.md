# Executive Summary: Reinforcement Learning in Pacman

## Overview
Comparative study of four reinforcement learning algorithms (Basic DQN, Sophisticated DQN, Dueling DQN, and A2C) in a Pacman environment, trained for 30 episodes each and evaluated over 10 episodes.

## Key Results

### Performance Metrics
| Algorithm         | Avg Score | Completion Rate | Avg Steps |
|------------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| A2C              | 121.00    | 70.00%         | 322.30    |
| Basic DQN        | 46.00     | 80.00%         | 244.10    |
| Sophisticated DQN| 28.00     | 70.00%         | 437.50    |
| Dueling DQN      | 13.00     | 60.00%         | 507.70    |

### Top Performer: A2C
- Highest average score (121.00)
- Best utilization of complex actions
- Most consistent performance
- Efficient step usage considering action complexity

### Notable Findings
1. Basic DQN showed highest completion rate despite simpler architecture
2. Complex architectures struggled with stability
3. No algorithm achieved win conditions
4. A2C maintained complex action usage throughout training

## Recommendations

### Short-term Improvements
1. Extend training duration
2. Implement reward shaping for win conditions
3. Enhance exploration strategies

### Long-term Development
1. Hybrid approaches combining DQN and A2C strengths
2. Implementation of advanced algorithms (PPO, SAC)
3. Dynamic difficulty adjustment

## Conclusion
A2C demonstrates superior performance in complex action spaces, while simpler architectures show benefits in reliability. Future work should focus on achieving win conditions and improving stability across all algorithms.
